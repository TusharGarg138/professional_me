My name is Tushar garg. I'm a engineering student from symbiosis. I'm originally from Delhi NCR, India, but I moved to punjab in 2006.
I love all foods, particularly French food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
my favourite footballer in messi.
